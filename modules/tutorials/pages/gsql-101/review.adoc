You have learned a lot in GSQL 101!

With just the knowledge from GSQL 101 and a little practice, you should be able to do the following:

* Create a graph schema containing multiple vertex types and edge types.
* Define a loading job that takes one or more CSV files and maps the data directly to the vertices and edges of your graph.
* Write and run simple parameterized queries which start at one vertex and then traverse one or more hops to generate a final vertex set.
* Make a simple additive computation and return the results.

* To learn to do the same types of operations using the GraphStudio Visual SDK and UI, see the xref:3.2@gui:graphstudio:overview.adoc[TigerGraph GraphStudio UI Guide].
* Continue learning xref:pattern-matching/README.adoc[Pattern Matching].
