= openCypher in GSQL


openCypher is a popular open-source declarative query language for property graphs. More about openCypher can be found at http://opencypher.org[openCypher.org].

TigerGraph's GSQL query language supports many openCypher features. This page lists the features currently xref:_opencypher_features_in_gsql[supported] and features xref:_opencypher_features_not_yet_supported[not yet supported ].

To see how to run openCypher on the TigerGraph platform, see xref:openCypher-in-gsql.adoc[].

=== Clauses

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Clause |Description

|DELETE |Delete graph elements — nodes and relationships.

Any node to be deleted must also have all associated relationships explicitly deleted.

|DETACH DELETE |Writing Delete a node or set of nodes.

All associated relationships will automatically be deleted.

|LIMIT |Reading sub-clause A sub-clause used to constrain the number of records in the output.

|MATCH |Reading Specify the patterns to search for in the database.

|MANDATORY MATCH |Reading Specify the patterns to search for in the database, and fail if no match is found.

|ORDER BY [ASC[ENDING] DESC[ENDING]] |Reading sub-clause A sub-clause following

|RETURN or WITH |Specifying that the output should be sorted in either ascending (the default) or descending order.

|RETURN … [AS] |Projecting Defines what to include in the query result set.

|SKIP |Reading/Writing A sub-clause defining from which record to start including the records in the output.

|WITH … [AS] |Projecting Allows query parts to be chained together, piping the results from one to be used as starting points or criteria in the next.

See below for restrictions.

|WHERE |Reading sub-clause A sub-clause used to add constraints to the patterns in a MATCH clause, or to filter the results of a WITH clause.

=== Syntax

Certain openCypher syntax is also *not* supported.

* Queries with a *WITH* clause that *does not* implicitly group by exactly one vertex variable.

. 0 vertex variables as group key
[source,gsql]
MATCH (u:User {name: "John") // find all users with the same friend count as John
WITH     u.friendCount AS fc   // note, u not included in group key list
MATCH  (o:User {friendCount: fc})
…

. More than 1 vertex variables as group key
[source,gsql]
MATCH (u1) -[:communication]- (x) -[:communication]- (u2)
WITH     u1, u2, COUNT(x) // we support only u1 or only u2 in list
…

* Queries introducing path variables
[source,gsql]
MATCH p = (u1) -[e1:communication]- (x) -[e2:communication]- (u2)	// p is path var
…

* Queries whose *MATCH* pattern *does not* include at least one vertex variable from immediately preceding *WITH* clause.
[source,gsql]
MATCH (u:user) -[:communication]- (o)
WITH     u, …
MATCH (x) -[:communication]-(y)		// this pattern must refer to u
…

* Queries with disconnected *MATCH* pattern fragments
[source,gsql]
MATCH (x:user), (y:user)
WHERE x.friendCount = y.friendCount
…

* Pattern fragments (x:user) and (y:user) *are not* connected by edge traversal or by sharing vertex variables.
