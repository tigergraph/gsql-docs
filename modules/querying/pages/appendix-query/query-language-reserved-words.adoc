= Query Language Reserved Words

The following words are reserved for use by the GSQL query language. That is, a query may not use any of these words for a user-defined identifier, such as the name of a local variable or a local TUPLE type.

=== History:

* v3.1: Added `TAGS`, `RESET_COLLECTION_ACCUM`, `WITH`

There is a separate list for xref:ddl-and-loading:appendix:keywords-and-reserved-words.adoc[Reserved Words for the *GSQL DDL Language*]. +
The compiler will reject the use of a Reserved Word as a user-defined identifier.
