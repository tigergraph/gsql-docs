= Attribute Data Types
:description: An overview of data types supported by vertex and edge attributes in TigerGraph.

In a TigerGraph instance, a graph consists of different types of vertices and edges.
Each type of vertex and edge can have attributes associated with that type.
For example, a Book vertex could have title, author, publication year, genre, and language attributes.

Each attribute of a vertex or edge has an assigned data type.
This page describes the different data types that can be stored in vertex and edge attributes.

== Primitive types

Primitive types are the most basic data types available within GSQL.
They can also be used to construct other complex data types.

|===
| Name | Default value | Valid input format (regex) | Range and precision | Description

| `INT`
| 0
| [-+]?[0-9]+
| --2{caret}63 to +2{caret}63 - 1 (-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807)
| 8-byte signed integer

| `UINT`
| 0
| [0-9]+
| 0 to 2{caret}64 - 1 (18,446,744,073,709,551,615)
| 8-byte unsigned integer

| `FLOAT`
| 0.0
| [ -+ ] ? [ 0 - 9 ] * . ? [ 0 - 9 ] +( [ eE ] [ -+ ] ? [ 0 - 9 ] + ) ?
| +/- 3.4 E +/-38, ~7 decimal digits of precision.
| 4-byte single-precision floating point number  Examples: 3.14159, .0065e14, 7E23  See note below.
| `DOUBLE`
| 0.0
| [ -+ ] ? [ 0 - 9 ] * . ? [ 0 - 9 ] +( [ eE ] [ -+ ] ? [ 0 - 9 ] + ) ?
| +/- 1.7 E +/-308, ~16 decimal digits of precision
| 8-byte double-precision floating point number.
Has the same input and output format as FLOAT, but the range and precision are greater. See note below.

| `BOOL`
| false
| true, false (case insensitive), 1, 0
| true, false
| Boolean true and false, represented within GSQL as _true_ and _false_ , and represented in input and output as 1 and 0

| `STRING`
| Empty string
| .*
| UTF-8 encoding.
A string attribute does not have a maximum length limit by itself.
However, the size of all attributes of a vertex or edge combined cannot exceed 10 MB.
| Character string.
The string value can optionally be enclosed by single quote marks or double quote marks.
|===

[NOTE]
====
[For v3.9.2+] FLOAT and DOUBLE values are displayed with up to 7 and 16 digits of precision, respectively.
====

[IMPORTANT]
.Exponential notation
====
For `FLOAT` and `DOUBLE` values, the GSQL Loader can read input values in exponential notation (e.g., 1.25 E-7), but the GSQL query language cannot.

GSQL may display output values with exponential notation, however.
====

[WARNING]
====
Some numeric expressions may return a non-numeric string result, such as "inf" for Infinity or "NaN" for Not a Number.

|===

[NOTE]
====
The legacy data type `STRING COMPRESS` has been deprecated since TigerGraph Server 3.0.
You can no longer create new schema with the type `STRING COMPRESS`.
As such, we have removed `STRING COMPRESS` from the documentation.

Existing schemas that are using `STRING COMPRESS` can continue to function normally.
If you need reference for `STRING COMPRESS`, please refer to GSQL Language Reference version 3.5 or older.
====

Additionally, GSQL also supports the following complex data types:

== Collection types

* `LIST`: A list is an *ordered* collection of elements of the same type.
** Default value: an empty list `[]`
** Supported element types: `INT`, `DOUBLE`, `STRING`, `DATETIME`, and `UDT`
** To declare a list type, use angle brackets `<>` to enclose the element type, e.g. `LIST<STRING>.`
+
[WARNING]
====
Due to multithreaded GSQL loading, the initial order of elements loaded into a list might be different from their order in the input data.
====
* `SET`: A set is an *unordered* collection of *unique* elements of the same type.
** Default value: an empty set `()`
** Supported element types: `INT`, `DOUBLE`, `STRING`, `DATETIME`, and `UDT`.
** To declare a set type, use angle brackets `<>` to enclose the element type, e.g. `SET<INT>`
* `MAP`: A map is a collection of key-value pairs. It cannot contain duplicate keys and each key maps to one value.
** Default value: an empty map
** Supported key types: `INT`, `STRING`, and `DATETIME`
** Supported value types: `INT`, `DOUBLE`, `STRING`, `DATETIME`, and `UDT`.
** To declare a map type, use `<>` to enclose the types, with a comma to separate the key and value types, e.g., `MAP<INT, DOUBLE>`.

== User-defined tuples

A *User-Defined Tuple (UDT)*  represents an ordered structure of several fields of the same or different types.
The supported field types are listed below.
Each field in a UDT has a fixed size.
A `STRING` field must be given a size in characters, and the loader will only load the first given number of characters.
An `INT` or `UINT` field can optionally be given a size in bytes.

|===
| Field type | User-specified size | Size | Range (N is size)

| `INT`
| Optional
| 1, 2, 4, or 8 bytes. Default is 8.
| 0 to 2{caret}(N*8) - 1

| `UINT`

| 1, 2, 4, or 8 bytes. Default is 8.
| -2{caret}(N*8 - 1) to 2{caret}(N*8 - 1) - 1

| `FLOAT`
| No
| 4 bytes
| -3.4 E-38 to 3.4 E38

| `DOUBLE`
| No
| 8 bytes
| -1.7 E-308 to 1.7 E308

| `DATETIME`
| No
|
| 1582-10-15 00:00:00 to 9999-12-31 23:59:59

| `BOOL`
| No
|
| `true` or `false`

| `STRING`
| Required
| Any number of characters
| Any string under N characters
|===

A UDT must be defined before being used as a field in a vertex type or edge type.
To define a UDT, use the `TYPEDEF TUPLE` statement. Here is an example of a `TYPEDEF TUPLE` statement:

.UDT Definition
[source.wrap,gsql]
----
TYPEDEF TUPLE <field1 INT(1), field2 UINT, field3 STRING(10), field4 DOUBLE> My_Tuple
----

In the above example, `My_Tuple` is the name of the UDT.
It contains four fields: an 1-byte `INT` field named `field1`, a 4-byte `UINT` field named `field2`, a 10-character `STRING` field named `field3`, and an (8-byte) `DOUBLE` field named `field4`.
