= SELECT Statement (Syntax V1)
:description: Reference documentation for the legacy V1 syntax of the GSQL SELECT statement.

This page describes the GSQL `SELECT` statement in GSQL Syntax V1.
The default syntax is syntax v2.
To use syntax v1, you need to declare the syntax at the query level or in a xref:tigergraph-server:gsql-shell:gsql-sessions.adoc#_session_parameters[session parameter].

The `SELECT` block uses a _step_ _pattern_ to select some of the graph's vertices and edges. There are a number of optional clauses that define and/or refine the selection by constraining the vertex or edge set or the result set. The final output of a query is either a vertex set known as the _result set_ or a table.

[WARNING]
====
Size limitation

There is a maximum size limit of 2 GB for the result set of a SELECT block . If the result of the SELECT block is larger than 2 GB, the system will return no data. NO error message is produced.

----



In classic GSQL, the SELECT statement is an assignment statement with a SELECT block on the right-hand side. The initial clause is the SELECT clause: `SELECT vertexAlias`. Its purpose is to specify which set of vertices from the FROM clause is to become the output. The classic SELECT clause may contain only one item: a vertex alias defined in the FROM clause. As of v3.1, the vertex alias may be from anywhere in a multi-hop pattern, not only an endpoint. GSQL now also supports xref:querying:select-statement/sql-like-select-statement.adoc[SQL-like SELECT statements] with tabular output.

The <<_from_clause>> defines a path pattern to traverse in the graph, and each vertex in the path pattern can be given a vertexAlias name. Thus, the SELECT clause picks the set of vertices at one of these points in the pattern -- the source vertices, the target vertices, or those from an interior point in a multi-hop path -- to be the output vertices.

The SELECT block has many optional clauses, which fit together in a logical flow. Overall, the SELECT block starts from a source set of vertices and returns a result set that is either a subset of the source vertices or a subset of their neighboring vertices. Along the way, computations can be performed on the selected vertices and edges. The figure below graphically depicts the overall SELECT data flow. While the ACCUM and POST-ACCUM clauses do not directly affect which vertices are included in the result set, they affect the data (accumulators) which are attached to those vertices.

== FROM Clause

In classic (Syntax v1) GSQL, the FROM clause describes one step or hop pattern.

.FROM clause
[source,ebnf]
----
fromClause := FROM (step | stepV2 | pathPattern ["," pathPattern]*)
----

A hop or step consists of going from a starting set of vertices, crossing over a set of their edges, to an ending set of vertices.
We typically use the names Source and Target for the starting and ending vertex sets: `+Source -(Edges)-> Target+`

The step pattern defines constraints for the Source set, the Edge set, and the Target set. The result of the FROM clause can be interpreted as a 3-column virtual table called the match table. Each row is a 3-element tuple: (source vertex, connected edge, target vertex).

=== Source Vertex Set (SYNTAX v1)

Notice that the edge set and target set are optional: a step can be just source vertices (stepSourceSet).

.EBNF for source-only pattern (SYNTAX v1)
[source,ebnf]
----
step   :=  stepSourceSet ["-" "(" stepEdgeSet ")" ("-"|"->") stepVertexSet]
----



[NOTE]
====
Rules for Source Vertex Set in Syntax V1:

. The source set may only be a vertexSetName. If this the first SELECT statement in the query, then the vertexSetName is generally created as a seedsSet:
. The vertexSetName is optionally followed by an alias, which used in subsequent clauses to refer to the source set:
+
[source,ebnf]
----
stepSourceSet := vertexSetName [":" vertexAlias]
vertexAlias := name
----
+
====

For example:

[source,gsql]
----
resultSet = SELECT s FROM Source:s;
----

This statement can be interpreted as "_Select all vertices s, from the vertex set Source_ ." The result is a vertex set. Below is a simple example of a vertex selection.

=== 1-Hop Step (SYNTAX v1)

Usually, a FROM clause has a full 1-hop step.

[source,ebnf]
----
step   :=  stepSourceSet ["-" "(" stepEdgeSet ")" ("-"|"->") stepVertexSet]
----

The symbols `-(` and `)-` enclose the stepEdgeSet and separate the three parts. Each of the three parts may also define an alias, which makes a convenient way to refer to each of the three sets of entities.

[source,ebnf]
----
stepSourceSet := vertexSetName [":" vertexAlias]
stepEdgeSet := [setEdgeTypes] [":" edgeAlias]
stepVertexSet := [setVertexTypes] [":" vertexAlias]
----

Below is a simple example:

[source,gsql]
----
Person:s -( (Bought|Rented):e )- (Product|Service):t
----

The Source set is all Persons, but the pattern will not include all Persons. It will only include those Persons who Bought or Rented a Product or Service. Moreover, the result will be a set of matched triples: (s, e, t). For example, if Sam bought a TV and Andy rented a car, the results will include (Sam, Bought, TV) and (Andy, Rented, Car). However, these two facts do not imply (Sam, Rented, Car) or (Andy, Rented, TV).

[CAUTION]
====
The GSQL grammar allows the right-hand enclosure to be either `)-` or +
`+)->+`. Previously, we recommended the arrowhead `+)->+` .
However, for better compatibility with the new V2 pattern matching syntax, we now recommend the headless version: `)-`.
Syntax v2 has a specific semantic meaning for the arrowheads.
====

=== Edge Set and Target Vertex Set Options

[NOTE]
====
*Rules for Edge Set and Target Set in Syntax V1:*

. The edge set (*`stepEdgeSet`*) and target vertex set (*`stepVertexSet`*) obey very similar rules. Each may be a set specifier (*`stepEdgeTypes`* or *`stepVertexTypes`*) followed optionally by an alias.
. The set specifier can be any of the following:
** *`"_"`* or *`"ANY"`* or <blank>, which means any edge/vertex.
** a named type (*`edgeType`* or *`vertexType`*)
** a global SetAccum accumulator containing a set of edges or vertices (*`"@@"accumName`*)
** a string or string set parameter which names one or more edge or vertex types  (*`paramName`*) This parameterized type is one aspect of xref:querying:query-operations.adoc[*Dynamic Querying*].
** A list of types, string parameters, or global accumulators, e.g., *`"(" edgeSetType ["|" edgeSetType]* ")"`*
** The list of types must contain the same type of specifiers.
+
[source,ebnf]
----
stepEdgeSet := [setEdgeTypes] [":" edgeAlias]
stepVertexSet := [setVertexTypes] [":" vertexAlias]
alias := (vertexAlias | edgeAlias)
vertexAlias := name
edgeAlias := name

stepEdgeTypes := atomicEdgeType
               | "(" edgeSetType ["|" edgeSetType]* ")"
atomicEdgeType := "_" | ANY | edgeSetType
edgeSetType := edgeType | paramName | globalAccumName

stepVertexTypes := atomicVertexType
                 | "(" vertexSetType ["|" vertexSetType]* ")"
atomicVertexType := "_" | ANY | vertexSetType
vertexSetType := vertexType | paramName | globalAccumName
----

| (empty)

| given type

| string parameter holding a vertex/edge type name
| given type

| global SetAccum containing vertices or edges
| given set

| (name \| name ...)
| UNION of two or more collections
|===

[NOTE]
====
Parentheses are always needed around the edge type in a FROM clause: +
`FROM Source:s -(eType:e)- Target:t`

Parentheses are also needed if a vertexEdgeType is the union of more than one or more individual edge types or vertex types: +
`FROM Source:s -((eType1 | eType2):e) - Target:t`

Note the double set of parentheses for the edge specifier.
If there is an edge alias, these parentheses are needed.
If however there is no edge alias, it is legal to have just a single set of parentheses: +
`FROM Source:s -(eType1 | eType2) - Target:t`
====

Either the source vertex set ( s ) or target vertex set ( t ) can be used as the SELECT argument, which determines the result of the SELECT statement. Note the small difference in the two SELECT statements below.

.Selecting source or target vertices from edge-induced selection
[source,gsql]
----
resultSet1 = SELECT s FROM source:s-(eType:e)-tType:t;   //select from the source set
resultSet2 = SELECT t FROM source:s-(eType:e)-tType:t;   //select from the target set
----



resultSet1 is based on the source end of the edges. resultSet2 is based on the target end of the selected edges. However, resultSet1 is NOT identical to the Source vertex set. It is only those members of Source which connect to an eType edge and then to a tType vertex. Other clauses (presented later in this "SELECT Statement" section, can do additional filtering of the Source set.

[WARNING]
====
We strongly suggest that an alias should be declared with every vertex and edge in the FROM clause, as there are several functions and features which are only available to vertex and edge aliases.
====

It is legal to declare an alias without explicitly stating an edge/target type. See the examples below.

=== Vertex and Edge Aliases

Vertex and edge _aliases_ are declared within the FROM clause of a SELECT block, by using the character ":", followed by the alias name. Aliases can be accessed anywhere within the same SELECT block. They are used to reference a single selected vertex or edge of a set.
It is through the vertex or edge aliases that the attributes of these vertices or edges can be accessed.

For example, the following code snippets show two different SELECT statements. The first SELECT statement starts from a vertex set called allVertices, and the vertex alias name *v* can access each individual vertex from allVertices. The second SELECT statement selects a set of edges. It can use the vertex alias *s* to reference the source vertices, or the alias *t* to reference the target vertices.

.Vertex variables
[source,gsql]
----
results = SELECT v FROM allVertices:v;
results = SELECT t FROM allVertices:s -()-> :t;
----



The following example shows an edge-based SELECT statement, declaring aliases for all three parts of the edge. In the ACCUM clause, the `e` and `t` aliases are assigned to local vertex and edge variables.

.Edge variables
[source,gsql]
----
results = SELECT v
          FROM allVertices:s -(:e)- :t
          ACCUM VERTEX v = t, EDGE eg = e;
----



[WARNING]
====
We strongly suggest that an alias should be declared with every vertex and edge in the FROM clause, as there are several functions and features only available to vertex and edge aliases.
====



== SAMPLE Clause

The SAMPLE clause is an optional clause that selects a uniform random sample from the population of edges or target vertices specified in the FROM argument.

[NOTE]
====
If you want to sample from a set of vertices directly, not from edges or from neighboring (target) vertices, then the following technique is simpler and faster:
====

.Select k random vertices from a vertex set S

[source,gsql]
----
random = SELECT s
         FROM S:s
         LIMIT k;
----



The SAMPLE clause draws from the edge population consisting of those edges which satisfy all three parts -- source set, edge type, and target type -- of the FROM clause. The SAMPLE clause is intended to provide a representative sample of the distribution of edges (or vertices) connected to _hub_ vertices, instead of dealing with all edges. A _hub_ vertex is a vertex with a relatively high degree. (The _degree_ of a vertex is the number of edges which connect to it. If edges are directional, one can distinguish between indegree and outdegree.)

.EBNF for Sample Clause
[source,ebnf]
----
sampleClause := SAMPLE ( expr | expr "%" ) EDGE WHEN condition # sample an absolute number (or a percentage) of edges for each source vertex.
              | SAMPLE expr TARGET WHEN condition              # sample an absolute number of edges incident to each target vertex.
              | SAMPLE expr "%" TARGET PINNED WHEN condition   # sample a percentage of edges incident to each target vertex.
----



The expression following SAMPLE specifies the sample size, either an absolute number or a percentage of the population. The expression in sampleClause must evaluate to a positive integer. There are two sampling methods. One is sampling based on edge id. The other is based on target vertex id: if a target vertex id is sampled, all edges from this source vertex to the sampled target vertex are sampled.

[WARNING]
====
Note: Currently, the WHEN condition that can be used with a SAMPLE clause is limited strictly to checking if the result of a function call on a vertex is greater than or greater than/equal to some number.
====

Given that the sampling is random, some details of each of the example queries may change each time they are run.

The following query displays two modes of sampling: an absolute number of edges from a source vertex and a percentage of edges from a source vertex. We use the computerNet graph (see Appendix D).
In computerNet, there are 31 vertices and 43 edges, but only 7 vertices are source vertices. Moreover, c1, c12, and c23 are hub nodes, with at least 10 outgoing edges each.  For the absolute count case, we set the size to 1 edge per source vertex, which is equivalent to a random walk. We expect exactly 7 edges to be selected.  For the percentage sampling case, we sample 33% of the edges for vertices which have 3 or more outgoing edges. We expect about 15 edges, but the number may vary.

Below is an example of using SELECT to only traverse one edge for each source vertex. The vertex-attached accumulators @timesTraversedNoSample and @timesTraversedWithSample are used to keep track of the number of times an edge is traversed to reach the target vertex. Without using sampling, this occurs once for each edge; thus @timesTraversedNoSample has the same number as the in-degree of the vertex. With sampling edges, the number of edges is restricted. This is reflected in the @timesTraversedWithSample accumulator. Notice the difference in the result set. Because only one edge per source vertex is traversed when the SAMPLE clause is used, not all target vertices are reached. The vertex *company3* has 3 incident edges, but in one instance of the query execution, it is never reached. Additionally, *company2* has 6 incident edges, but only 4 source vertices sampled an edge incident to *company2* .

== WHERE Clause

The WHERE clause is an optional clause that constrains edges and vertices specified in the FROM and SAMPLE clauses.

.EBNF for Where Clause
[source,ebnf]
----
whereClause := WHERE condition
----



The WHERE clause uses a boolean condition to test each vertex or edge in the FROM set (or the sampled vertex and edge sets, if the SAMPLE clause was used).

If the expression evaluates to false for vertex/edge X, then X excluded from further consideration in the result set. The expression may use constants or any variables or parameters within the scope of the SELECT, arithmetic operators (+, -, \*, /,%), comparison operators (==, !=, <, \<=, >,>=), boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT), set operators (IN, NOT IN) and parentheses to enforce precedence. The WHERE conditional expression may use any of the variables within its scope (global accumulators, vertex set variables, query input parameters, the FROM clause's vertex and edge sets (or their vertex and edge aliases), or any of the attributes or accumulators of the vertex/edge sets.) For a more formal explanation of condition, see the EBNF definitions of *condition* and *expr.*

Using built-in vertex and edge attributes and functions, such as .type and .neighbors(), the WHERE clause can be used to implement sophisticated selection rules for the edge traversal.  In the following example, the selection conditions are completely specified in the WHERE clause, with no edge types or vertex types mentioned in the FROM clause.

.WHERE used as a filter

[source,gsql]
----
resultSet1 = SELECT v FROM S:v-((E1|E2|E3):e)-(V1|V2):t;
resultSet2 = SELECT v FROM S:v-(:e)-:t
					 WHERE t.type IN ("V1", "V2") AND
						   t IN v.neighbors("E1|E2|E3")
----



The following examples demonstrate using the WHERE clause to limit the resulting vertex set based on a vertex attribute.

[WARNING]
====
If multiple edge types are specified in edge-induced selection, the WHERE clause should use OR to separate each edge type or each target vertex type. For example,

.Multiple Edge Type WHERE clause

[source,gsql]
----
CREATE QUERY multipleEdgeTypeWhereEx(vertex<person> m1) FOR GRAPH socialNet SYNTAX V1 {
  allUser = {m1};
  FilteredUser = SELECT s
      FROM allUser:s - ((posted|liked|friend):e) - (post|person):t
      # WHERE e.actionTime > epoch_to_datetime(1) AND t.gender == "Male";
      WHERE ( e.type == "liked" AND e.actionTime > epoch_to_datetime(1) ) OR
            ( e.type == "friend" AND t.gender == "Male" )
            ;
  PRINT FilteredUser;
}
----



The above query is compilable. However, if we use line 5 as the WHERE clause instead, the query is not compilable. The edge-type conflict checking detects an error, because i t uses attributes from both "liked" edges and "friend" edges without separating them out by OR.
====

== ACCUM and POST-ACCUM Clauses

The optional ACCUM and POST-ACCUM clauses enable sophisticated aggregation and other computations across the set of vertices or edges selected by the preceding FROM, SAMPLE, and WHERE clauses. A query can contain one or both of these clauses. The statements in an ACCUM clause are applied for every edge in an edge-induced selection or every vertex in a vertex-induced selection.

If there is more than one statement in the ACCUM clause, the statements are separated by commas and executed sequentially for each selected element. However, the TigerGraph system uses parallelism to improve performance. Within an ACCUM clause, each edge is handled by a separate process. As such, there is no fixed order in which the edges are processed within the ACCUM clause and the edges should not be treated as executing sequentially. The accumulators are mutex variables shared among each of these processes. The results of any accumulation within the ACCUM clause is not complete until all edges are traversed. Any inspection of an intermediate result within the ACCUM is incomplete and may not be that meaningful.

[WARNING]
====
The statements within the ACCUM clause are executed sequentially for a given vertex or edge.  However, there is no fixed order in which a vertex set or edge set is processed.
====

The optional POST-ACCUM clause enables aggregation and other computations across the set of vertices (but not edges) selected by the preceding clauses. POST-ACCUM can be used without ACCUM. If it is preceded by an ACCUM clause, then it can be used for 2-stage accumulative computation: a first stage in ACCUM followed by a second stage in POST-ACCUM.

[WARNING]
====
Each statement within the POST-ACCUM clause can refer to either source vertices or target vertices but not both.
====

Since the ACCUM clause iterates over edges, and often two edges will connect to the same source vertex or to the same target vertex, the ACCUM clause can be repeated multiple times for one vertex.

[WARNING]
====
Operations that are to be performed exactly once per vertex should be performed in the POST-ACCUM clause.
====

The primary purpose of the ACCUM or POST-ACCUM clause is to collect information about the graph by updating accumulators (via += or =). See the "Accumulator" section for details on the += operation. However, other kinds of statements (e.g., branching, iteration, local assignments) are permitted to support more complex computations or to log activity. The EBNF syntax below defines the allowable kinds of statements that can occur within an ACCUM or POST-ACCUM.  The *dmlSubStmt* list is similar to the *queryBodyStmt* list which applies to statements outside of a SELECT block; it is important to note the differences.  Each of these statement types is discussed in one of the main sections of this reference document.

.EBNF for ACCUM and POST-ACCUM Clauses

----



[WARNING]
====
Note that dml-sub-statements do not include global accumulator assignment statement (gAccumAssignStmt) but global accumulator accumulation statement (gAccumAccumStmt). Global accumulators may perform accumulation += but not assignment "=" within these clauses.
====

[WARNING]
====
There are additional restrictions on dml-sub level statements:

* Global variable assignment is permitted in ACCUM or POST-ACCUM clauses, but the change in value will not take place until the query completes. Therefore, if there are multiple assignment statements for the same variable, only the final one will take effect.
* Vertex attribute assignment "=" is not permitted in an ACCUM clause. However, edge attribute assignment is permitted. This is because the ACCUM clause iterates over an edge set. Vertex attribute assignment is permitted in the POST-ACCUM clause. Like all updates, the change in value does not take place until the query completes.
====

=== Aliases and ACCUM/POST-ACCUM Iteration Model

To reference each element of the selected set, use the aliases defined in the FROM clause.  For example, assume that we have the following aliases:

.Example of vertex and edge aliases

[source,gsql]
----
FROM source:s -(edgeTypes:e)- targetTypes:t # edge-induced selection
FROM source:v                                # vertex-induced selection
----



Let  (V1, V2,... Vn) be the vertices in the vertex-induced selection . The following pseudocode emulates ACCUM clause behavior.

.Model for ACCUM behavior in vertex-induced selection

[source,gsql]
----
FOREACH v in (V1,V2,...Vn) DO # iterations may occur in parallel, in unknown order
  dmlSubStmts referencing v
DONE
----



Let E = (E1, E2,... En) be the edges in the edge-induced selected set. Further, let S = (S1,S1,...Sn) and T= (T1,T2,...Tn) be the multisets (bags) of source vertices and target vertices which correspond to the edge set.  S and T are bags, because they can contain repeated elements.

.Model for ACCUM behavior in edge-induced selection

[source,gsql]
----
FOREACH i in (1..n) DO # iterations may occur in parallel, in unknown order
  dmlSubStmts referencing e, s, t, which really means e_i, s_i, t_i
DONE
----



Note that any reference to the source alias s or target alias t is for the endpoint vertices of the current edge.

Similarly, the POST-ACCUM clause acts like a FOREACH loop on the vertex result set specified in the SELECT clause (e.g., either S or T).


=== Edge/Vertex Type Inference and Conflict

If multiple edge types are specified in edge-induced selection, each ACCUM statement in ACCUM clause checks whether edge types are conflicted. If only a subset of edge types are effective in an ACCUM statement , this statement is not executed on other edge types. For example:

.Multiple Edge Type ACCUM statement check

[source,gsql]
----
CREATE QUERY multipleEdgeTypeCheckEx(vertex<person> m1) FOR GRAPH socialNet SYNTAX V1 {
  ListAccum<STRING> @@testList1, @@testList2, @@testList3;
  allUser = {m1};
  allUser = SELECT s
         FROM allUser:s - ((posted|liked|friend):e) - (post|person):t
         ACCUM @@testList1 += to_string(datetime_to_epoch(e.actionTime))
              ,@@testList2 += t.gender
             #,@@testList3 += to_string(datetime_to_epoch(e.actionTime)) + t.gender # illegal
               ;
  PRINT @@testList1, @@testList2, @@testList3;
}
----



In the above example, line 6 is only executed on "liked" edges, because "actionTime" is the attribute of "liked" edge only. Similarly, line 7 is only executed on "friend" edges, because "gender" is the attribute of "person" only, and only "friend" edge uses "person" as target vertex. However, line 8 causes a compilation error, because it uses multiple edges where some edges cannot be supported in a part of the statement, i.e., "liked" edges doesn't have t.gender, "friend" edges doesn't have e.actionTime.

[WARNING]
====
We strongly suggest that if multiple edge types are specified in edge-induced selection, ACCUM clauses should uses CASE statement (see Section "Control Flow Statements" for more details) to separate the operation on each edge type or each target vertex type (or combination of target vertex type and edge type). The edge-type conflict checking then checks the ACCUM statement inside each THEN/ELSE blocks based on the condition. For example,

.Multiple Edge Type ACCUM statement check 2

[source,gsql]
----
CREATE QUERY multipleEdgeTypeCheckEx2(vertex<person> m1) FOR GRAPH socialNet SYNTAX V1 {
  ListAccum<STRING> @@testList1;
  allUser = {m1};
  allUser = SELECT s
            FROM allUser:s - ((posted|liked|friend):e) - (post|person):t
            ACCUM CASE
                    WHEN e.type == "liked" THEN    # for liked edges
                      @@testList1 += to_string(datetime_to_epoch(e.actionTime))
                    WHEN e.type == "friend" THEN   # for friend edges
                      @@testList1 += t.gender
                    ELSE      # For the remained edge type, which is posted edges
                      @@testList1 += to_string(datetime_to_epoch(t.postTime))
                  END
            ;
  PRINT @@testList1;
}
----



The above query is compilable. However, if we switch line 8 and line 10, the edge-type conflict checking generates errors because "liked" edges doesn't support t.gender and "friend" edges doesn't support e.actionTime.
====

Similar to the ACCUM clause, if multiple source/target vertex types are specified in edge-induced selection and the POST-ACCUM clauses accesses source/target vertex, each ACCUM statement in POST-ACCUM clause checks whether source/target vertex types are conflicted. If only a subset of source/target vertex types are effective in a POST-ACCUM statement, this statement is not executed on other source/target vertex types.

[WARNING]
====
Similar to ACCUM clause, we strongly suggest that if multiple source/target vertex types are specified in edge-induced selection and the POST-ACCUM clauses accesses source/target vertex, POST-ACCUM clauses should uses CASE statement (see Section "Control Flow Statements" for more details) to separate the operation on each source/target vertex type. The vertex type conflict checking then checks the ACCUM statement inside each THEN/ELSE blocks based on the condition.

=== Rules for Updating Vertex-Attached Accumulators

Prior to v1.0, a vertex-attached accumulator could only be updated in an ACCUM or POST-ACCUM clause and only if its vertex was selected for by the preceding FROM-SAMPLE-WHERE clauses.

Beginning in v1.0, there are additional circumstances where a vertex-attached accumulator may be updated. Vertices which are _referenced via a vertex-attached accumulator of a selected vertex_ may have their vertex-attached accumulators updated in the ACCUM clause (but not in the POST-ACCUM clause).  That is, a vertex referenced by an selected vertex can be updated, with some limitations explained below. Some examples will help to illustrate this more complex condition.

* Suppose a query declares a vertex-attached _accumulator which holds vertex information_ . We call this a *vertex-holding accumulator* . This could take several forms:
** A scalar accumulator, e.g., MaxAccum< *VERTEX* > @maxV;
** A collection accumulator: e.g., ListAccum< *VERTEX* > @listV;
** An accumulator containing tuple(s), where the tuple type contains a *VERTEX* field.
* If a vertex V is selected, then not only can V's accumulators be updated, but the vertices stored in its vertex-holding accumulators can also be updated, in the ACCUM clause.
* Before these indirectly referenced vertices can be used, they need to be *activated* . There are two ways to activate an indirect vertex:
** A vertex from a vertex-holding accumulator is first assigned to a local vertex variable.
The vertex can then be updated through the local vertex variable.

[source,gsql]
----
ACCUM
  VERTEX<person> mx = tgt.@maxV,   # assign to local variable
          mx.@curId += src.id      # access via local variable
----

* A FOREACH loop can iterate on a vertex-holding collection accumulator. The vertices can now be updated through the loop variable.

[source,gsql]
----
ACCUM
  FOREACH vtx IN src.@setIds DO   # iterate on collection accumulator
      vtx.@curId += tgt.id        # access via loop variable
  END
----

[WARNING]
====
The following uses are NOT supported by the new rules:

* Indirectly activated vertices may not be updated in the POST-ACCUM clause or outside a SELECT statement.
* Passing a vertex into the query as an input parameter is not a route to activation.
* Using a global vertex-holding accumulator is not a route to activation.
* If a vertex is being indirectly activated by assigning it to a local variable (e.g., a variable declaring in ACCUM or POST-ACCUM), note the following rule, which always applies to all local variables:
** A local variable can be declared and initialized in an ACCUM block once.  It cannot be redeclared or reassigned later in the ACCUM block.
====

The following query demonstrates updates to indirectly activated vertices.

== HAVING Clause

The optional HAVING clause provides constraints on the result set of the SELECT.
The constraints are applied *after* ACCUM and POST-ACCUM actions.
This differs from the WHERE clause, which is applied *before* the ACCUM and POST-ACCUM actions.

.EBNF for HAVING Clause
[source,ebnf]
----
havingClause := HAVING condition
----

The condition in a `HAVING` clause is applied to each vertex in the `SELECT` set (either source or target vertices) which also fulfilled the `FROM` and `WHERE` conditions.
The `HAVING` clause is intended to test one or more of the accumulator variables that were updated in the `ACCUM` or `POST-ACCUM` clause, though the condition may be anything that equates to a boolean value.
If the condition is false for a particular vertex, then that vertex is excluded from the result set.

The following example demonstrates using the HAVING clause to constrain a result set based on the vertex accumulator variable which was updated during the ACCUM clause.

== ORDER BY Clause

The optional ORDER BY clause sorts the result set.

.EBNF for ORDER BY Clause
[source,ebnf]
----
orderClause := ORDER BY expr [ASC | DESC] ["," expr [ASC | DESC]]*
----



ASC specifies ascending order (least value first), and DESC specifies descending order (greatest value first). If neither is specified, then ascending order is used. Each expr must refer to the attributes or accumulators of a member of the result set, and the expr must evaluate to a sortable value (e.g., a number or a string). ORDER BY offers hierarchical sorting by allowing a comma-separated list of expressions, sorting first by the leftmost expr.  It uses the next expression only to sort items where the current sort expr results in identical values. Any items in the result set which cannot be sorted (because the sort expressions do not pertain to them) will appear at the end of the set, after the sorted items.

[CAUTION]
====
In tabular SELECT queries, the ORDER BY expressions may only be SELECT column aliases.
====

The following example demonstrates the use of ORDER BY with multiple expressions. The returned vertex set is first ordered by the number of friends of the vertex, and then ordered by the number of coworkers of that vertex.

== LIMIT Clause

The optional LIMIT clause sets constraints on the number and ranking of items included in the final result set.

.EBNF for LIMIT Clause

[source,ebnf]
----
limitClause := LIMIT ( expr | expr "," expr | expr OFFSET expr )
----



Each of the expr must evaluate to a nonnegative integer. To understand LIMIT, note that the tentative result set is held in the computer as a list of vertices. If the query has an ORDER BY clause, the order is specified; otherwise the list order is unknown.  Assume we number the vertices as v_1 , v_2 , ..., v_n . The LIMIT clause specifies a range of vertices, starting from a lower position in the list to an upper position.

There are three forms:

.LIMIT scenarios

[source,gsql]
----
result = SELECT v FROM S -(:e)- :v LIMIT k;		  # case 1: k = Count
result = SELECT v FROM S -(:e)- :v LIMIT j, k; 	  # case 2: j = Offset from the start of the list, k = Count
result = SELECT v FROM S -(:e)- :v LIMIT k OFFSET j; # case 3: k = Count, j = Offset from the start of the list
----



Case 1: LIMIT k

* When a single expr is provided, LIMIT returns the first *k* elements from the tentative result set. If there are fewer than *k* elements available, then all elements will be returned in the result set.  If k=5 and the tentative result set has at least 5 items, then the final result list will be [ v_1 , v_2 , v_3 , v_4 , v_5 ].

Case 2: LIMIT j, k

* When a comma separates two expressions, LIMIT treats the first expression *j* as an offset.  That is, it skips the first *j* items in the list.  The second expr *k* tells the maximum number of items items to include. If the list has at least 7 items, then LIMIT 2, 5 would return [ v_3 , v_4 , v_5, v_6  _,_ v_7 ].

Case 3: LIMIT k OFFSET j

* The behavior of Case 3 is the same as that of Case 2, except that the syntax is different.  The keyword OFFSET separates the two expressions, and the count comes before the offset, rather than vice versa. If the list has at least 7 items, then LIMIT 5 OFFSET 2 would return [ v_3 , v_4 , v_5, v_6 , v_7 ].

If any of the expressions evaluate to a negative integer, the results are undefined.

[NOTE]
====
OFFSET is intended for result sets which are in a known order. It is a compile time error to use OFFSET without the ORDER BY clause.
====

The following examples demonstrate the various forms of the LIMIT clause.

The first example shows the LIMIT clause when used as an upper limit. It returns a result set with a maximum size of 4 elements in the set.

The following example shows the alternative syntax for a result size limit with an offset.
This time we try larger values for offset and size.  In a large data set, limitTest(5,20) might return 20 vertices, but since we don't have 25 vertices in the original data, the output was fewer than 20 vertices.
