= Functions

This section provides references the functions that are available in the GSQL Data Definition and Loading (DDL) Language that operate on input tokens.

Token functions are functions that operate on input tokens during data loading.
These functions allow you to clean and format your raw data, as well as transform the raw data to better fit with your graph schema.

There are four types of token functions:
